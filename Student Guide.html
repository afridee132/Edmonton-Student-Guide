    <h1>Welcome to Edmonton</h1>
    <h2>Settling in</h2>
    <div id="residence">
        <h3>Residence</h3>
        <p>If you’re a First year student, consider staying <a href="https://www.residence.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">on Campus</a>.
            Lister might be a great option for you – its an amazing place to meet with lots of people.
            You might not get the best food here, but the network you create 2will surely last!
            If you wanna stay off campus, sites like <a href="https://www.kijiji.ca/h-edmonton/1700203" target="_blank">Kijiji</a>, Facebook Marketplace,
            <a href="https://www.rentfaster.ca/ab/edmonton/" target="_blank">RentFaster</a>,
            <a href="https://www.rentboard.ca/rentals/index.aspx?locid=207" target="_blank">RentBoard</a>,
                    <a href="https://rentmidwest.com/property-listings/" target="_blank">Midwest Property Management</a> etc are good places to look. </p>

        <h3>Groceries</h3>
        <p>Consider this: Its cold in Edmonton, you don’t wanna walk outside a lot. Pick something that’s close to you.
            Also, there is barely any minimum price for most products here. Sometimes you might have to pay
            CAD 2.99 for a pop in a restaurant, where as you could also get a dozen pops for CAD 4.00 in groceries.
            Given that, some of the cheaper groceries include:
            <a href="https://www.walmart.ca/en" target="_blank">Walmart</a>,
                <a href="https://www.realcanadiansuperstore.ca/" target="_blank">Superstore</a>,
            <a href="https://www.nofrills.ca/" target="_blank">No Frills</a>.
            <a href="https://www.safeway.ca/" target="_blank">Safeway</a> and
            <a href="https://www.sobeys.com/en/" target="_blank">Sobeys</a>
            are a bit more pricey.
            <a href="https://www.mymacs.ca/" target="_blank">Mac’s</a> is open 24/7 and hence costs more too.<br>

        <h3>Things to do</h3>
        <p>University can be pretty depressing at times. Why not go out and spend some meaningful time?
            Starting from <a href="https://icecastles.com/edmonton/" target="_blank">Ice Castle</a>,
            <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_events/muttart-conservatory.aspx" target="_blank">Muttart Conservatory</a>,
            <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/visitor/tours_info.html" target="_blank">Alberta Legislature Building</a>
            to more nature beauty places like
            <a href="https://botanicgarden.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">UofA Botanical Garden</a> and
            <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/elkisland" target="_blank">Elk Island</a>,
            Edmonton has got many attractions and activities to offer. Or if you’re a little more
            adventurous why not plan a trip to Banff or Jasper? Take into account the costs associated with each
            activity, you never want to walk a lot in winter. When visiting places, you might strive to call an Uber or CAB;
            however that is expensive. If you have a driving license, consider renting a car for long trips.

    <div id="airport">
        <h3>Airport</h3>
        <p>As an International Student, you should get a free shuttle service for the first time.
            Make sure you register for it beforehand. There is also an option for bus: take ETS (Edmonton Transit Service)
            747 followed by LRT (Light rail Transit) from Century Park (Its almost impossible to do that with 2 big luggage).
            Ofcourse CAB and Co-op are available; and if you
            want to go with UBER, make sure you link your Debit/Credit card to it. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="banks">
        <h3>Banks</h3>
        <p>Once you arrive in Canada, one of the first things you have to do is open a bank account and deposit your money.
        Most banks don't charge for student accounts. The following are of the most common banks in Edmonton</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/solutions/student-banking/international-students-in-canada/" target="_blank>">TD Bank</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cibc.com/en/student/bank-accounts.html" target="_blank>">CIBC</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/accounts/student-banking.html" target="_blank>">RBC</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/bank-accounts/students.html" target="_blank>">Scotia Bank</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.bmo.com/main/personal/students/" target="_blank>">BMO</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://get.atb.com/Personal/Bank/Student-Accounts/Students-First-Account/p/2307" target="_blank>">ATB</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>Note:It is important to build a credit history in North America. Hence it's advisable to get a credit card. Be careful though,
        you might have to pay high interests if you don’t pay back on time!

    <div id="mobile">
        <h3>Mobile Plans</h3>
        <p>For decent plans with yoru SIM cards, you're looking at anything between CAD 40-60</p>
        <p><strong>Phone Contracts:</strong>No one likes contracts!<br>
            You are likely to not be eligible for phone contracts in your first 6 months of arrival. On top of that,
            if you break the costs down, you usually end up paying more for phone under contract.
            However you might still consider this if you
        <ul>
        <li>Get an insane deal</li>
        <li>Don't want to pay the upfront cost of a new phone right away</li>
    </ul></p>
